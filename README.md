## WHAT IS A PROJECT

A project is a temporary endevour

> In the context of project management the word `temporary` means something has a start and end date. An `on-going` effort is one that does NOT have and end date, therefore it is NOT a project.

### Variaty of Projects

Projects can by divided in to three categories:

- **Predictivie**: This is the **traditional** way where each stage or phase of the project needs to be meet in order to proceed with the next one. That's way it is called `waterfall`, because water flows from A to B.

- **Adaptive**: This is the relative new model where repetition/iteration is well seen. `Agile` is an example of adaptive projects. In Agile change is ok, and change is seen as a feature.

- **Hybrid**: It's a combination of predictive and adaptive projects, example, working in a project that needs to meet regulations or stric rules, in this scenario the requirements are set but the building process can be done via iterations.

Key takeaways:

- Increment means delivering something
- Iterative means repeat.




Business Analysis involves `identifying` business `needs` and determining solutions to business problems. **Poorly defined or misunderstood requirements are one of the leading causes of `project failure`. Business analysis focuses heavily on requirement**
