## WHAT IS A PROJECT

A project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique service or result

- **Temporary** (in the context of project management) means it has a start and end date.

> Note. An `on-going` effort is one that does NOT have and end date, therefore it is **NOT a project**. Another common terms for an on-going effort are continuing, repetitive, open-ended

NOT A PROJECT: Noe is fixing bugs in **continuing** task.

### Variaty of Projects

Projects can by divided in to three categories:

- **Predictivie**: This is the **traditional** way where each stage or phase of the project needs to be meet in order to proceed with the next one. That's way it is called `waterfall`, because water flows from A to B.

- **Adaptive**: This is the relative new model where repetition/iteration is well seen. `Agile` is an example of adaptive projects. In Agile change is ok, and change is seen as a feature.

- **Hybrid**: It's a combination of predictive and adaptive projects, example, working in a project that needs to meet regulations or stric rules, in this scenario the requirements are set but the building process can be done via iterations.

### Projects VS Operations

Operations are activities that occur repetitively and produce deliverables that are similar.

`Manufacturing` is an example of operations.

Operations in IT (information technology): Operation teams are responsible for maintaining, managing, and optimizing existing systems to ensure their reliability and performance.

**To remember: Operations are NOT projects.**

Trick example:

- A bakary is not a project because the product is expected to be the same and the process is repetitive.
- BUT, what if you want to create a **new** kind of bread? in that case that can be a project, the result will be unique and the process will be different, it will aso have a start and end date.

> So keep an eye in the details provided in each scenario.

#### Project-based operations

These are combinations of operations but the product usually is customized so it needs to be handled as a project. Example: expensive cars that allows you to choose the wheels, seats, color, etc. etc.

Software as a Service is another example of project-based operations. You may rent a software to manage your clients but you may want to have specific features or customized your logo, text, theme, etc.

### Key takeaways:

- Increment means delivering something
- Iterative means repeat.




Business Analysis involves `identifying` business `needs` and determining solutions to business problems. **Poorly defined or misunderstood requirements are one of the leading causes of `project failure`. Business analysis focuses heavily on requirement**
